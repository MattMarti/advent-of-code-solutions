# Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 challenges.
This year, I decided to use Rust to solve the problems to help
myself learn the language.

The commit history in this repo won't match up with the days
between the first and the eleventh of the month. I started
working on the problems in a private repo, and commited the
inputs. I started this new repo so that I could share the
solutions publicly, without having the data files stored in the
commit history.
